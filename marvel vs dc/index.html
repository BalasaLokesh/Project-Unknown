        <p style="color:black" class="text-monospace">Beginning with the first release of a DC comic in 1934, quickly   followed by the premiere of Marvel comics,
          also known as Atlas Comics, in 1939, Marvel and DC have been two of the most well known comic companies of all
          time. Both have been close rivals in the industry, at times mirroring each other’s stories and characters, but
          when it comes the the overall superiority of one over the other, there is a clear winner. While Marvel may
          have the upperhand when it comes to cinematics, DC has it beat because of its characters and impact on the
          world.
        </p>

        <p style="color:black;" class="text-monospace">The main reason why DC comics outshine Marvel comics is because the characters in the universe are more unique
          and more empowering. One of the most popular heroes in the DC universe is Bruce Wayne, otherwise known as
          Batman. One reason he is so popular with fans is because he is a regular human who has trained himself to be
          great. He is also a vigilante. While Marvel may have vigilantes, none of them are as popular as DC’s
          vigilantes, which include Batman and Green Arrow. Vigilantes are characters who work outside the law, which
          can be empowering to societies because it supports the idea of fighting for changes to things that are unjust
          in your own society. One hero that is very empowering is Superman. While some may believe he is overpowered, I
          believe that Superman has some of the most difficult villains to fight, therefore he should have lots of
          powers. Superman is one of my favorite heros because of how inspiring he is. The same goes for Supergirl.
        </p>

        <p style="color:black;" class="text-monospace">Another reason DC is better than Marvel is because the massive impact it has had on society. One good example
          of this is Wonder Woman. A large reason why Wonder Woman was created and published in 1941 was because of
          World War II. She was made to support the allies, and inspire the people during the war. Comics during this
          time showed victories against the foes fought by Wonder Woman herself. She was also made to inspire the women
          that stayed home during the war. She pushed that society should be supporting those in the war and expressing
          nationalism as a way to promote victory in the war. This is one of the reasons DC comics are so special,
          because they create a mirror to what was happening in society during their time by having the heroes beat the
          odds and come out victorious.
        </p>

        <p style="color:black;" class="text-monospace">Although DC may be superior in the comic area, Marvel has it beat when it comes to movies. Marvel has made
          many good movies that do their fun characters justice. While they may not all be the most inspiring stories,
          they are very good entertainment, and supply audiences with good jokes and good storylines. While DC has made
          a few great movies including Wonder Woman and The Dark Knight, overall, their storylines can be difficult to
          follow because of how action-packed they are. Marvel Cinematic Studios has DC beat because they are consistent
          in delivering good movies.
        </p>

        <p style="color:black;" class="text-monospace">While Marvel excels when it comes to delivering quality films, DC is superior to Marvel overall because it has
          created excellent characters, and inspiration to the real world. Although Marvel has some excellent characters
          itself including The Incredible Hulk, Spiderman, and the X-Men, DC not only has characters like these, but
          they also have used those characters to empower society and in a sense, fight crime of the real world. DC
          proves better than Marvel because of the special content it brings audiences.

      <p style="color:black;" class="text-monospace">In the beginning, the two publishers showed distinct differences in their storytelling. On one hand, DC was known for telling colorful stories of gods who performed incredible feats to protect humanity and the greater good. Superman was the standard when it came to superheroes, and he was surrounded by other characters with innate godlike abilities—Aquaman, The Flash, Wonder Woman, and more. Batman, a human character, became extraordinary by pushing himself to the limit to keep up with these super-powered peers at every turn.On the other, Marvel was known for having a more human approach. Average Joe characters like Peter Parker were suddenly granted superhuman abilities, while others overcame major flaws to do great things, giving everyday people hope that they too could reach their potential. Tony Stark was a jerk who learned the price of hubris and scientist Bruce Banner had to cope with his destructive alter-ego. Thor was a Norse god, but even his story fits the bill: Odin banishes him to Earth for a lesson in humanity.As time went on, these lines began to blur. Some speculate that it was the result of the industry evolving in order to survive. Some feel it’s connected to the two publishing houses constantly swapping talent over the years. Either way, you can still find some of the old spirit that differentiated the two back in the day if you look close enough. You’re also just as likely to see plenty of similarities.

      <p style="color:black;" class="text-monospace">They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. If that statement holds true, Marvel and DC have been flattering each other for years.Whether you’ve realized it or not, many of the most popular comic book characters today are legitimate ripoffs of characters already in existence. Both publishers are guilty of stealing ideas from the other.This happened for a variety of different reasons. Some were tongue-in-cheek copies made to poke fun at the competing publisher, while others were honest attempts at capitalizing on something that worked. A handful of these instances are so blatant that readers couldn’t believe how bold the moves were, while others are much more subtle.Don’t believe me? This list from Comicsland sums it up: Deadpool (Marvel) is a blatant spoof of Deathstroke (DC). Doom Patrol (DC) teamed up three months before X-Men (Marvel). Namor (Marvel) hit the oceans three years before Aquaman (DC). Red Tornado (DC) came to life just two months before Vision (Marvel.

      <p style="color:black;" class="text-monospace">Deciding who was the best in comics used to depend mostly on who wrote and illustrated the best stories. Then those stories started coming to life through television and film, sparking a new whole new debate that continues to this day with every major theatrical release and television series.Most people would say that Marvel is the clear favorite in this category because of recent box office and critical successes, but it’s worth noting that the MCU was only created 10 years ago. Before that, the victor was much more unclear.We could spend days merely listing all of DC and Marvel movies, TV shows, animated series, before we get down to the business of who did it better. Instead, let’s turn to the numbers.According to Rotten Tomatoes, both publishers have their fair share of massive hits and major duds. At the end of the day, they’re in good company with each other.
      The average Tomatometer score for DC Comics products comes out to 67.7 percent while Marvel’s average out to 64.1 percent. (Rotten Tomatoes calculated the scores based on 130 media properties in November 2017.)The last decade may heavily favor Marvel’s MCU—especially with recent hits like Black Panther and Thor: Ragnarok. By comparison, Justice League received lackluster reviews. But let’s not forget the pedestal the Dark Knight trilogy still sits on, alongside decades of beloved screen adaptations featuring Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. 
      Marvel may be having its day in the cinematic sun right now, but DC has many years of great film adaptations under its utility belt.

      <p style="color:black;" class="text-monospace">While comic book heroes are more popular than ever, that hasn’t translated to a boom in the number of issues moving off of comic shop shelves or even through digital retailers.In 2017, the top selling single issue was Marvel Legacy #1, which sold just over 300,000 copies. In 1969, that would have just barely cracked into the top 10. Back then, Superman led the group by averaging over half a million in sales, and just three years prior, Batman dominated with an average of 898,000 sales per issue.This sharp decline in sales is the result of many, many factors—enough to be worthy of a dissertation.But, to cut to the chase, they include advancements in technology, the mishandling of representation in comics (both on the page an in the office), and just a general shift in public consumption of entertainment. But it’s still interesting to watch the numbers and see what they show.For example, just four years ago, DC Comics didn’t have a single title crack the top 10, while Marvel claimed seven of the top spots. (The remainder went to smaller comics publishers.) But by 2017, DC held six of the top spots, while Marvel Comics took four.  Here’s the ranking for single-issue comics (excluding graphic novels) as of the end of 2017 according to Comichron.
